# KMK + Pog + Taipo for the Debroglie / Weekin WK-50 Trackball Keyboard
KMK firmware files for the WK-50 I got from AliExpress.
Taipo is implemented to be able to have a keyboard and a "16-button programmable" ambidextrous trackball.

Copy the files into CIRCUITPY after pog has installed KMK onto it. 

I don't know how if or how often the autogenerated kb.py will change in future pog versions so you may want to manually add the Taipo append code:
```
# Add your own modules and extensions here
# or sort them into the correct spot to have the correct import order

# Taipo
from taipo import Taipo
keyboard.modules.append(Taipo())
```
