# KMK + Pog + Tetaipo for the Debroglie / Weekin WK-50 Trackball Keyboard
KMK firmware files for the WK-50 I got from AliExpress.
Tetaip is implemented to be able to have a keyboard and a "16-button programmable" ambidextrous trackball.

Similar to how CircuitPython would prefer if a not-entirely-compatiable board was called "SuperDuperPython" or something similar, it's probably best if I call my mutation of Taipo something (slightly) different. Tetaip is essentially a Tetent-themed version of Taipo Flat.

The main change is that space/bksp/shft are on the smallest finger, Finger4 (aka "pinky"). Aditionally, chording a character whilst pressing the space key will add a space after it (since space is pressed the most often).

# Setup

Copy the files into CIRCUITPY after pog has installed KMK onto it. 

I don't know how if or how often the autogenerated kb.py will change in future pog versions so you may want to manually add the Taipo append code:
```
# Add your own modules and extensions here
# or sort them into the correct spot to have the correct import order

# Tetaip
from taipo import Taipo
keyboard.modules.append(Taipo())
```
